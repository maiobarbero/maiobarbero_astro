If you work with multiple Git repositories, youâ€™ve likely run into the frustration of ignoring the same files (like `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, or your IDE settings) over and over again. Fortunately, Git allows you to define a global `.gitignore` file that applies to all repositories on your system. This is done through the `core.excludesfile` configuration option.

In this article, I'll walk you through how to set up a global `.gitignore` file using `git config`.


## ðŸŽ¯ Why Use a Global .gitignore?

Some files are specific to your system or development environment and should never be committed to *any* project. Examples include:

- macOS system files (`.DS_Store`)
- Windows thumbnails (`Thumbs.db`)
- IDE configs (`.idea/`, `.vscode/`)
- Log files (`*.log`)
- Local environment files (`.env`)

Instead of duplicating the same ignore rules in every repo, a global `.gitignore` keeps things DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).


## ðŸ›  Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Create the Global .gitignore File

Start by creating a `.gitignore_global` file in your home directory (or anywhere you prefer):

```bash
touch ~/.gitignore_global
```

Then, edit it and add the rules you want:

```bash
# macOS
.DS_Store

# Windows
Thumbs.db

# IDEs
.vscode/
.idea/

# Logs
*.log

# Env files
.env
```

### 2. Configure Git to Use the Global File
Tell Git to use this file globally:

```bash
git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
```

You can verify it worked with:

```
git config --global core.excludesfile
```

This should output the path you just set.
