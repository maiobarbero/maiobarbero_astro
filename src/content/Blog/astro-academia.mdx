For academics websites are crucial for showcasing their research, publications, and professional achievements. To help them out, I decided to create a free and open-source website template specifically designed for academics.

## About Astro Academia

Astro Academia is a website template built using [Astro](https://astro.build/), a modern static site generator. The template is designed to be easy to use and customize, even for those who may not have extensive web development experience. It includes several features that are particularly useful for academics, such as:

- **Publication List**: Easily showcase your research papers and publications.
- **CV Page**: Display your curriculum vitae in a clean and organized manner.
- **Blog**: Share your thoughts and updates with a built-in blog.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure your website looks great on all devices.

## Key Features

### Easy to Customize

The template is built with simplicity in mind. You can easily customize the content and appearance of your website by editing a few configuration files and markdown files. The use of Tailwind CSS allows for easy styling adjustments.

### Built with Astro

Astro is a modern static site generator that offers excellent performance and flexibility. It allows you to use your favorite front-end frameworks like React, Vue, or Svelte, while still generating static HTML for fast load times.

### Free and Open Source

Astro Academia is completely free to use and open source. You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/maiobarbero/astro_academia). Contributions and feedback are welcome!

## Getting Started

Following the [official documentation](https://github.com/maiobarbero/astro_academia) you will be able to edit the layout and to add data like your cv and your pubblications. Astro Academia also support blog.
## Conclusion

I created Astro Academia to help academics easily create and maintain their personal websites. It is a free and open-source template that is easy to use and customize. I hope this project can help many academics showcase their work and achievements without the hassle of building a website from scratch.
